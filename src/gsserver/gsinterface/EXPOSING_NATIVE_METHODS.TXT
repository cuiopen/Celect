To expose native methods to GSClasses:

1) DLL name must be same namespace as the GSClass. Ex. GSClass 'Cluster.ObjectLocatorServer' will require Cluster.dll.

2) There is no need to inject the DLL, DLL just has to be in the same folder as the client.
   If DLL is not loaded when a nativemethodref is called, it will be automatically loaded.

3) For every 'CLASS' method you wish to expose, create an exported function with the following name:
   GSNativeGetMethodImpl_DLLNAME_CLASSNAME

4) This function will ACCEPT a single parameter of type char* containing the method name to be looked up.
   PS: This method name includes parameters, ex: init(ClientConfiguration,string)

5) This function will RETURN a pointer to the function that needs to be exposed.
