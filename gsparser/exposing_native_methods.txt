To expose native methods to GSClasses:

1) There is no need to inject the DLL, DLL just has to be in the same folder as the client.
   If DLL is not loaded when a nativemethodref is called, it will be automatically loaded.

2) For every 'CLASS' method you wish to expose, create an exported function with the following name:
   GSNativeGetMethodImpl_DLLNAME_CLASSNAME

3) This function will ACCEPT a single parameter of type char* containing the method name to be looked up.
   PS: This method name includes parameters, ex: init(ClientConfiguration,string)

4) This function will RETURN a pointer to the function that needs to be exposed.
